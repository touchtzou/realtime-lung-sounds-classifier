
Important general notes:
-----------------------
 
1. There are some small spelling errors in 'enstitu_makalemiz.doc'. Further-
   more, the type of fonts used in the tables, for example, will result in
   errors if this file is copied or insterted into another file. This can be
   solved by defining a new type of font that is only used with the text in tables
   or figures.
2. The Mahalanobis leave-one-out results were modified. This means that
   the results in the table in the final printed Thesis Book are not valid.
   (the new results were rewritten in the paper submitted to the Physiological
   Measurement Journal).
3. The Source Code was also modified to include the changes made to the Mahalanobis
   Distance measure. However, these changes were made so that the maximum performace
   results are obtained (which gave results higher than the ones inculded in the
   paper submitted to the Phsiyol. Meas. Journal).
4. Be aware if there are any changes made on the names or locations of the sound files
   that are called by the different Power Point presentations (duzeltildi cogu).
